WBTC is an ERC-20 token that represents 1 bitcoin held in custody by BitGo and currently has around $10 million outstanding. The liquidation ratio remains the same as the other collateral assets (150%) while the debt ceiling and stability fee are set at 10 million Dai and 1%, respectively.\\n\\nWhy it matters\\nSince Black Thursday Dai\\u2019s peg has consistently been above $1, which is a cause for concern for any stablecoin. In order to alleviate this problem, Maker governance scrambled to add USDC with the hope more Dai would be minted to restore the peg. Since then, the price has dropped but has yet to be restored. The addition of WBTC could provide that extra liquidity needed to bring Dai back to $1.\\n\\nThis won\\u2019t be the first time WBTC can be used as collateral in DeFi as the third largest lending platform, Aave, supports it. However, there has not been much interest in using the custodied bitcoin as only 55 WBTC are currently in the system.\",\n",

      "            \"content\": \"<a href=\\\"https://messari.io/article/makerdao-gets-stress-tested-as-eth-price-plummets\\\">Last week</a>, a rapid price decline coinciding with congestion on the Ethereum network led to ETH collateral being sold for free and a $4 million shortfall on MakerDAO. In order to bring the system back to a healthy state, MKR will be created and auctioned off to make up for the lost collateral value. Starting on March 19th at 10:25 UTC, anyone will be able to participate by running an Auction Keeper to bid for the newly minted MKR. The tokens will be auctioned off in lots for 50,000 Dai starting at a price of 250 MKR ($200) and then Keepers can place bids of smaller amounts of MKR for the same 50,000 Dai thus increasing the price. If no one bids for the first lot, then the auction will begin again in three days, offering 20% more MKR for the Dai lot translating to a price of $166.\\n\\nWhy it matters\\nThe Debt Auction exists in case a highly improbable event is able to undercapitalize what many believe to be a relatively safe system. The confluence of events last week did exactly that and now the last resort measure needs to be taken. Similar to a follow-on equity offering where shareholders are diluted, MKR holders lose value on a per-token basis but the capital acquired in the sale is thought of as necessary to increase the long-term value of the network.\\nIn order to prevent the price from tanking further, various ecosystem participants led by the founder of Dharma, have pledged to participate in the auction. In addition to this list, prior round investor Paradigm announced plans to add to their existing position by participating in the auction.\",\n",

      "            \"content\": \"In the midst of extreme market-wide turmoil, <a href=\\\"https://messari.io/asset/maker\\\">MakerDAO</a> is facing one of its biggest challenges to date. The main form of collateral in the system, Ether, has dropped over 30% in a 24-hour timeframe marking one of the worst days in its short history. This has triggered an unprecedented wave of liquidations as loans quickly became undercollateralized.\\n\\nSource: Dune Analytic. Scripts created by Teo Leibowitz. \\n\\nNormally when the price drops causing a position to fall below the 150% required collateralization ratio, third-party liquidation bots known as Keepers can bid Dai for the underlying collateral in return for a small fee. This ensures the system remains whole and the debt is fully paid back. However, things became complicated today as the Ethereum network became congested leading to oracle\\u2019s price updates not going through with the gas price they chose.\\n\\nThis means Maker was not receiving the correct price of ETH needed to ensure proper liquidations. At one point the price feeds were showing $166 while the real price was 15% lower.  Not only did this affect oracles, but Keepers likely did not have their bots configured to bid up gas prices meaning the collateral bids were also not going through, allowing some lucky liquidators to escape with collateral for free. This put the system in a $4 million deficit since collateral was leaving the system without any debt being paid back. \\n\\nWhy it matters\\nThe value in stablecoins like <a href=\\\"https://messari.io/asset/dai\\\">Dai</a> lies in the fact they can be redeemed for their underlying collateral. In circumstances such as this, when there isn\\u2019t adequate collateral to back the asset, it can break the system unless otherwise remedied. To prevent this, MakerDAO has a Debt Auction mechanism where the protocol can inflate the supply of MKR in order to make up for the losses. This amount to a system-wide bailout where MKR holders shoulder the burden by way of dilution in order to keep the network functioning. \\nAnother worst-case option being considered is an Emergency Shutdown. This would unwind the whole system returning collateral to Vault owners first and then to Dai holders who would be at risk of receiving a haircut. If this were to occur, it would likely erode faith in the idea of crypto-collateralized stablecoins, damaging one of the most essential components of Open Finance.\\n\",\n",

The first type of collateral to be available is Basic Attention Token (<a href=\\\"https://messari.io/asset/basic-attention-token\\\">$BAT</a>) which will have an initial debt ceiling of three million Dai compared to 50 million for Ether (<a href=\\\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\\\">$ETH</a>).\\n\\nThe current single collateral Dai (\\u201cSai\\u201d) will continue to exist while users are encouraged to migrate to the new Dai. Another major change is the introduction of the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) which acts as an interest-bearing savings account. Unlike traditional accounts, it does not lend the money out, but rather it pays interest to depositors using funds from the Stability fee.\\nWhy It Matters:\\nNew collateral types should increase the addressable market of collateralized debt as well as the stability of the system by diversifying the debt pools. \\nThe Stability Fee has been changed significantly throughout the year jumping from 0.5% to over 20% back down to 5%. The DSR provides another lever to adjust in order to keep Dai around $1 which should lessen interest rate volatility. \",\n",

A governance vote will be held on Friday that could increase the debt ceiling by $10 - $20 million.\\n\\nWhy it matters:\\nMaker continues to be the dominant DeFi lending platform and interest continues to grow as the project moves closer to a Nov. 18 upgrade that will add collateral types beyond just Ethereum (<a href=\\\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\\\">$ETH</a>).\\nMaker\\u2019s stability fee has varied dramatically throughout the year hitting 20% over the summer before coming back down to where it is now.

The amount of Dai outstanding reflects the total debt in the system, which after peaking at $95 million in March, has since settled to around $85 million. By functioning as a decentralized U.S. dollar, Dai has become the standard in the DeFi space for use in other loan platforms, exchanges and derivative products. Currently, 17% of all Dai are held in the Compound <a href=\\\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\\\">smart contract</a> earning interest with the second largest holder being <a href=\\\"https://messari.io/asset/dydx\\\">dYdX</a>.

Dissolving the organization that has maintained substantial power of the protocol would be another major step towards the goal of fully decentralizing.\\n\\nThe Maker Foundation has operated like a traditional startup with legal, accounting, marketing departments, etc. all funded through money raised from venture capital.

       "   'content': '<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/makerdao-gets-stress-tested-as-eth-price-plummets\">Last week</a>, a rapid price decline coinciding with congestion on the Ethereum network led to ETH collateral being sold for free and a $4 million shortfall on MakerDAO. In order to bring the system back to a healthy state, MKR will be created and auctioned off to make up for the lost collateral value. Starting on March 19th at 10:25 UTC, anyone will be able to participate by running an Auction Keeper to bid for the newly minted MKR. The tokens will be auctioned off in lots for 50,000 Dai starting at a price of 250 MKR ($200) and then Keepers can place bids of smaller amounts of MKR for the same 50,000 Dai thus increasing the price. If no one bids for the first lot, then the auction will begin again in three days, offering 20% more MKR for the Dai lot translating to a price of $166.\\n\\nWhy it matters\\nThe Debt Auction exists in case a highly improbable event is able to undercapitalize what many believe to be a relatively safe system. The confluence of events last week did exactly that and now the last resort measure needs to be taken. Similar to a follow-on equity offering where shareholders are diluted, MKR holders lose value on a per-token basis but the capital acquired in the sale is thought of as necessary to increase the long-term value of the network.\\nIn order to prevent the price from tanking further, various ecosystem participants led by the founder of Dharma, have pledged to participate in the auction. In addition to this list, prior round investor Paradigm announced plans to add to their existing position by participating in the auction.',\n",

       "   'content': 'In the midst of extreme market-wide turmoil, <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/maker\">MakerDAO</a> is facing one of its biggest challenges to date. The main form of collateral in the system, Ether, has dropped over 30% in a 24-hour timeframe marking one of the worst days in its short history. This has triggered an unprecedented wave of liquidations as loans quickly became undercollateralized.\\n\\nSource: Dune Analytic. Scripts created by Teo Leibowitz. \\n\\nNormally when the price drops causing a position to fall below the 150% required collateralization ratio, third-party liquidation bots known as Keepers can bid Dai for the underlying collateral in return for a small fee. This ensures the system remains whole and the debt is fully paid back. However, things became complicated today as the Ethereum network became congested leading to oracle’s price updates not going through with the gas price they chose.\\n\\nThis means Maker was not receiving the correct price of ETH needed to ensure proper liquidations. At one point the price feeds were showing $166 while the real price was 15% lower.  Not only did this affect oracles, but Keepers likely did not have their bots configured to bid up gas prices meaning the collateral bids were also not going through, allowing some lucky liquidators to escape with collateral for free. This put the system in a $4 million deficit since collateral was leaving the system without any debt being paid back. \\n\\nWhy it matters\\nThe value in stablecoins like <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/dai\">Dai</a> lies in the fact they can be redeemed for their underlying collateral. In circumstances such as this, when there isn’t adequate collateral to back the asset, it can break the system unless otherwise remedied. To prevent this, MakerDAO has a Debt Auction mechanism where the protocol can inflate the supply of MKR in order to make up for the losses. This amount to a system-wide bailout where MKR holders shoulder the burden by way of dilution in order to keep the network functioning. \\nAnother worst-case option being considered is an Emergency Shutdown. This would unwind the whole system returning collateral to Vault owners first and then to Dai holders who would be at risk of receiving a haircut. If this were to occur, it would likely erode faith in the idea of crypto-collateralized stablecoins, damaging one of the most essential components of Open Finance.\\n',\n",

Since the upgrade, the system has undergone a gradual change of upgrading single-collateral Dai (Sai) to the new Dai. \\n\\nSource: sai2dai.xyz\\n\\nWhile the first few days of migration were slow, recently more Sai has transitioned to Dai. This is in large part to major providers such as Compound supporting MCD, although they are still the largest Sai holder with over $13 million. More loans on Compound are expected to transition away from Sai since the interest rates on both the lending and borrowing sides are more favorable with Dai. The transition from SCD to MCD is arguably one of the most impactful upgrades the nascent DeFi space has experienced and seeing Dai surpass Sai in the near future is a sign of readiness to transition away from Sai altogether. \\n\\n',\n",

The first type of collateral to be available is Basic Attention Token (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/basic-attention-token\">$BAT</a>) which will have an initial debt ceiling of three million Dai compared to 50 million for Ether (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\">$ETH</a>).\\n\\nThe current single collateral Dai (“Sai”) will continue to exist while users are encouraged to migrate to the new Dai. Another major change is the introduction of the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) which acts as an interest-bearing savings account. Unlike traditional accounts, it does not lend the money out, but rather it pays interest to depositors using funds from the Stability fee.\\nWhy It Matters:\\nNew collateral types should increase the addressable market of collateralized debt as well as the stability of the system by diversifying the debt pools. \\nThe Stability Fee has been changed significantly throughout the year jumping from 0.5% to over 20% back down to 5%. The DSR provides another lever to adjust in order to keep Dai around $1 which should lessen interest rate volatility. ',\n",

      "            \"content\": \"The Kin engineering team has submitted a proposal to migrate Kin from its current Stellar-based chain over to Solana. Kik Iterative Inc., the creators of the Kin cryptoasset, said that Stellar\\u2019s five-second block times and limited metadata space within transactions were unsuitable for Kin\\u2019s user experience standards. It, therefore, began looking at alternative protocols in Q2 of last year before recently landing on Solana.\\n\\nAccording to the Kin team, Solana offers a substantial improvement in performance (reported 400 ms block times on a local test node). It also provides enough room within on-chain transactions for Kin to add data related to the Kin Rewards Engine (KRE). Otherwise, the project would have to resort to off-chain storage measures.\\n\\nKin developers would need to approve the proposal before any migration could occur. But CoinDesk reports the Solana staff would facilitate the transition, a process that \\u201cshould be complete in a matter of months.\\u201d The switch also comes with a financial incentive for the Kin Foundation. If approved, the Solana Foundation would grant Kin 1% of the total supply of SOL, with 0.1% unlocking for every new one million \\u201cmonthly active spenders\\u201d of KIN over 24 months (starting Jan. 2021).\\n\\nWhy it matters:\\nWhy make a move? The Kin Foundation says that its on-chain activity is accelerating. It self-reported that users spending KIN jumped from 1.5 million in March to 4.4 million in mid-April, hence the need to move to a more performant network. While it\\u2019s easy to inflate activity metrics, an analysis by CoinMetrics last year determined Kin does have a \\u201crelatively high number of on-chain transactions.\\u201d However, the value transferred across the network is lower than other blockchains, indicating Kin is primarily used for micro-transactions.\\nWhat does this say about Solana? While it is yet another green smart contract platform that offers a scalable alternative to existing platforms, it has a novel consensus mechanism in Proof of History, which aims to eliminate the time-intensive process of transaction ordering. But Solana still new, and its performance could degrade to an extent as more validators join the network. There\\u2019s also the argument that blockchains don\\u2019t have the user base to require highly scalable platforms. Focusing on maximizing transactions per second (TPS) might be putting the cart before the horse. The news is still a boost to Solana, which has announced several new partnerships as of late including one with <a href=\\\"https://messari.io/article/solana-prioritizes-stablecoin-support-by-partnering-with-terra\\\">stablecoin project Terra</a>.\",\n",

These witnesses reportedly led the creation of Steem\\u2019s contentious clone, Hive, <a href=\\\"https://messari.io/article/onchainfx-alert-steem-community-plans-a-hard-fork-to-cut-out-tron-owned-steemit\\\">back in March</a> and blocked current Steem supporters from receiving newly created HIVE tokens. Some have speculated that hard fork 0.23 is a retaliation against the Hive faction.\\n\\nIn an ironic twist, Steem\\u2019s upgrade last week sent the seized funds to a specific account (@community321) whose private keys were unknowingly kept by an anti-0.23 fork community member. This owner shipped almost all of the 23.6 million STEM to Bittrex with the message, \\u201cthese are stolen funds\\u2026please return them to their original owners prior to the fork.\\u201d In a blog post, Bittrex founder Richie Lai responded that while he doesn\\u2019t agree with the outcome, the exchange must adhere to the consensus rules. The funds remain in Bittrex\\u2019s position, but it reportedly plans to return them to the @community321 account.\\n\\nThe exchange could be holding the funds until current Steem witnesses regain control of the @community321 account. On Friday, witnesses launched soft fork 0.23.1 to limit the account\\u2019s transfer functions and remove community control over it.\\n\\nWhy it matters:\\nThe whole situation is a mess. It helps put in perspective that delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS) chains are very susceptible to hostile takeovers. Even Binance CEO CZ stated that zeroing accounts on a network means \\u201cit is overly centralized\\u201d (the irony is Binance Chain operates via a similar consensus mechanism at the moment). Warring sects of validators could be the fate of most dPoS chains down the road.\\nThe intra-network fight seems to be heading off-chain at the moment. Some of the former Steem validators affected by the latest hard fork are tentatively preparing to bring a class action lawsuit against exchanges that support it. Andreas Antonopoulos alluded to this outcome in a recent tweet, saying that the fork could result in a class action lawsuit with participating exchanges named defendants. On the opposing side, Decrypt recently reported that Tron creator Justin Sun is working with law enforcement over the HIVE tokens he claims were \\u201cstolen\\u201d from him.\",\n",

Read the full report here: <a href=\\\"https://messari.io/bitcoin-halving-2020/institutional\\\">Bitcoin's Third Halving: A Thesis for Institutional Investment</a>\\n\\nWhy Bitcoin?\\nCentral bank driven monetary debasement will boost institutional demand for store of value assets like gold and silver. But why Bitcoin? What makes it different from other politically neutral, scarce monetary stores of value?\\n\\nThe answer lies in Bitcoin\\u2019s sovereignty, its secular tailwinds, and its upside.\\n\\nSovereignty\\nKings and Queens used to be sovereign, then nation states became sovereign and now, for the first time, a humble computer platform has the aspiration to be sovereign. That is potentially revolutionary. - Wences Casares\\n\\nBitcoin is the first computing platform with the sovereignty of a nation-state. It\\u2019s the only monetary asset in the world with absolute scarcity. This scarcity is assured by a massive, global ecosystem of independent and diverse participants who run the Bitcoin protocol. While there are many clones that promise limited supplies, Bitcoin is the only that does so credibly.\\n\\nNo one can be prevented from using the Bitcoin blockchain to store and transfer value. In times of rising geopolitical tension, this is especially important and can\\u2019t be said for national currencies held in banks, which can and have historically been restricted and/or expropriated.\\n\\nUnlike monetary metals, bitcoin can be sent across the world in just hours and securely stored with just a seed phrase. This can be done in amounts large or small, providing a massive upgrade over metals.\\n\\nBitcoin is the first digital, politically neutral store-of-value the world has ever seen and its arrival couldn\\u2019t be more perfectly timed.\\n\\nSecular Tailwinds\\n\\nMoney is going fully digital.\\n\\nChina\\u2019a Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) began testing this year and despite initial regulatory headwinds, Facebook\\u2019s Libra is moving forward with a full head of steam. When these projects launch, they will expose billions of people to cryptocurrency related technologies.\\n\\nThese projects will get people comfortable with using cryptocurrency wallets and create massive on-ramps into more decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Combine this with a younger generation who\\u2019s expressed more openness toward cryptocurrencies and you have a recipe for mass adoption.\\n\\nUpside\\n\\nWhile the macroeconomic conditions create a positive outlook for precious metals, investors will be drawn to bitcoin because there is simply more upside.\\nBitcoin is not a company. It is a money. Monies are valued in trillions, not billions.\\n\\nThe total value of above-ground gold, which has limited industrial use, is valued at more than $10 trillion. The total value of all the base fiat money in the world is worth nearly $20 trillion dollars. Add in the total value of the global narrow money supply (demand deposits and checking accounts) and that number is $40 trillion.\\n\\nInvestors will be drawn to Bitcoin because there are few opportunities with as much asymmetric upside. To reach gold\\u2019s current market cap alone, Bitcoin would need to rise 63x from its current levels.\\n\\nThe truth remains that no one really knows what lies ahead for Bitcoin. With that said, its strong fundamentals, resilience in the face of economic uncertainty, and growing importance in today\\u2019s macroeconomic climate merits a look from all investors. What they do from there is anyone's guess.\\n\\nRead the full report here: <a href=\\\"https://messari.io/bitcoin-halving-2020/institutional\\\">Bitcoin's Third Halving: A Thesis for Institutional Investment</a>\",\n",

Particularly, venues with some overstated volume, but enormous legitimate trading volume at the same time. Giants like Bithumb, UpBit, and CoinOne in Korea, Liquid in Japan, and most importantly, Huobi, OKEx/OKCoin, and Gate.io in China.\\n\\nOther data services usually either ignore rampant overinflated volumes, conflate spot and derivatives volumes, or both. We decided to curate the data curators and take a common sense, admittedly imperfect, but directionally accurate approach towards estimating real trading volumes. But we knew we needed to add some missing exchanges to our methodology, so have decided to score exchanges for trading volume legitimacy based on a review of 10 different third party stats: exchange rankings, ratings, and liquidity estimates from CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, CryptoCompare, CryptoWatch (Kraken), Nomics, and FTX\\u2019s volume monitor, plus onchain transaction data from Chainalysis and other on-chain data providers, and anecdotal data from top traders.\\n\\nAs a result, we\\u2019ve added 10 exchanges to our \\\"real volume\\u201d metric, but applied a 50% haircut to the Korean and Chinese exchanges to better approximate their true volumes. We believe this better reflects the magnitude of adjustment necessary vs. simple web traffic comparisons, which usually discount these volumes by ~90%.\\n\\n(For what it's worth, this methodology also better aligns with scoring from FTX\\u2019s volume monitor, and the Alameda guys are pretty fucking good at trading.)\\n\\nThe results of our methodology change propel Huobi, OKEx, Liquid, Bithumb, and UPBit into the top 10 by volume without catapulting them past original \\u201cReal 10\\u201d constituents inaccurately. (Binance remains #1 by real volumes across most listed assets.)\\n\\nImportantly, we will review our methodology quarterly in order to add or remove constituent exchanges, and tweak volume adjustment parameters.\\n\\nIn a perpetual game of data cat and mouse, we believe the most conservative yet accurate method for updating real exchange volume estimates will be analogous to the \\u201chire slow, and fire fast\\u201d mantra in recruiting: slowly add additional exchanges as their volumes become material and multiple independent data services verify their data integrity, while quickly removing exchanges whose volumes spike outside of normal bands or raise red flags under third-party review. (Ours included.)\\n\\nThis is a necessary change, but one that may seem counterintuitive at first glance. I can assure you, though, that it is more accurate, if less precise, than alternatives.\\n\\n-TBI\\n\\nP.S. We welcome your feedback!

      "            \"content\": \"Coinbase\\u2019s custody arm has announced clients can now stake their Cosmos (ATOM) tokens through the custodian. The move allows these investors to lock their tokens on the network and collect inflation rewards on their otherwise idle holdings. Coinbase Custody also noted that its Cosmos staking services support delegations from offline storage systems as opposed to often less-secure hot storage alternatives.\\n\\nIn the announcement, the custodian also quietly revealed it also supports staking for Algorand (ALGO) in addition to Tezos (XTZ). Coinbase currently charges a 25% fee on XTZ received via block rewards, but it has not disclosed if this fee will carry over to AGLO or ATOM stakers at this time. According to Staking Rewards, the annual inflation for Cosmos is ~8.3%, while the same for Algorand stands around 5.4%\\n\\nWhy it matters:\\nEver since Coinbase listed ATOM, support for Cosmos staking was inevitable. The exchange turned Tezos staking into a legitimate revenue generator, and it should be only a matter of time before Coinbase opens staking rewards to all customers.\\n\\nWill this have a material impact on price like it did with Tezos? As <a href=\\\"https://messari.io/article/when-moon-cosmos\\\">we\\u2019ve covered before</a>, Cosmos\\u2019 staking model is fundamentally different from Tezos. It doesn\\u2019t have a \\u201cstaking capacity\\u201d metric that would force validators to top off their self-stake despots. Cosmos also penalizes error-prone validators by slashing 5% of their total stake weight, placing both validators and delegator funds at risk. While this risk could be a deterrent to some prospective delegators, exchanges that pledge to cover any customer losses (as Coinbase has) could preemptively purchase ATOMs equal to 5% of its stake weight for this insurance fund. From this perspective, Cosmos\\u2019 staking model could bear some similarities to Tezos. (h/t Brian Fabian Crain)\\n\\n\",\n",

However based on prior research on Satoshi\\u2019s coins, the nonce pattern of the block that contained the transaction spent today, does not match the nonce pattern of the blocks Satoshi is likely to have mined. The blocks Satoshi is likely to have mined have a distinct pattern, which can be seen from the very first block mined on Bitcoin. This entity (Patoshi) which many presume to be Satoshi mined more than 1.1 million bitcoins, equivalent to ~6% of the current 18.4 million coin supply.\\n\\nSource: Satoshiblocks\\n\\nWhy it matters:\\nIt is rare to see coins spent from 2009. Many of the coins mined from this period that have yet to move are presumed to be lost. While the coins likely don\\u2019t belong to Satoshi, it is the case that a Bitcoin OG spent those coins.\\nThe event and subsequent selloff suggests that there is some anxiety about the potential for Satoshi\\u2019s coins being moved. Satoshi is estimated to have over 1.1 million coins, and there is the fear (albeit overblown) that those coins could be market dumped on an exchange, which would tank Bitcoin\\u2019s price.\",\n",

      "            \"content\": \"TokenSoft, a security token issuance and platform, has used its own product to distribute equity to investors from its $4 million seed round raised almost two years ago. The company issued the tokenize shares on Ethereum using the ERC-1404 standard, which allows issuers to restrict certain transfer types to remain compliant with securities laws and any contractual obligations. According to TokenSoft, its investors will soon have access to real-time dividend payments in USD, by way of Signature Bank\\u2019s Signet platform, as well as the ability to buy and sell these shares on the secondary market.\\n\\nWhy it matters:\\nDespite receiving a lot of attention, tokenized securities have been slow out of the gate. They weren\\u2019t crypto enough for most investors knowledgeable on the matter, and traditional investors failed to see the appeal of tokenization over the norm. However, tokenizing shares has some perceived benefits, including improved access to secondary markets (as highlighted by TokenSoft). But the efforts to built more robust market infrastructure (e.g., Overstock\\u2019s <a href=\\\"https://messari.io/asset/tzero/profile\\\">tZERO</a>) have not yet led to an increase in investor demand.\\nERC-1404 was of the deluge of security tokens standards introduced on Ethereum from 2017 into 2018. Compared to the other, perhaps more robust alternatives (like the ST-20 or R-Token standards), it aims to offer a more straightforward way to restrict token transfers for instances such as enforcing token lockup periods.

The more palatable one will reduce the time it takes to unlock staked STEEM tokens (referred to as powering down) from thirteen weeks to just four. The second change, according to an interview with Steem witness Triple A, will aim to seize the accounts and assets of those that \\u201cpose a direct threat\\u201d to the Steem blockchain. Decrypt estimates the assets at stake total ~$5 million.\\n\\nAmong the 65 targeted accounts (posted earlier today) are the Steem witnesses accused of opposing Tron\\u2019s acquisition of Steemit Inc. and organizing the <a href=\\\"https://messari.io/article/onchainfx-alert-steem-community-plans-a-hard-fork-to-cut-out-tron-owned-steemit\\\">Hive hard fork on Mar. 20</a>. Triple A claims these accounts continue to harass the Steem ecosystem even after splitting off by spamming the network, damaging chain stability, and publicly attacking users, thus \\u201cjustifying\\u201d tomorrow\\u2019s hard fork.\\n\\nWhy it matters:\\nThe claims against the Hive network organizers are dubious at best as there isn\\u2019t any evidence to support these accusations. According to Decrypt, the seizures could instead be in retaliation for Hive supports excluding specific Steem witnesses from participating in the HIVE airdrop. Either way, this dilemma is another critical blow to the viability of delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) systems, which have not been able to adequately prevent validators from forming cartels and exploiting the network.\\nWhy would witnesses that left Steem for Hive even continue to hold any asset on Steem? The reason has to do with the aforementioned \\u201cpower down\\u201d period. STEEM stakers must wait thirteen weeks to unlock their holdings fully. The in-fighting on Steem began in mid-to-late Feb., roughly twelve weeks ago, and any witnesses that didn\\u2019t immediately start powering down would still have assets locked up on the network. For those accounts with access to their funds, trading STEEM for HIVE recently became more difficult as exchange service BlockTrades shut down support for STEEM deposits due to the secrecy behind tomorrow\\u2019s hard fork.\",\n",

      "            \"content\": \"The Tezos Foundation recently concluded its quarterly Council meeting with the announcement that current Council members Ryan Lackey and Michel Mauny will step down. Both will remain directly involved with the project, as Ryan will stay on as an advisor. At the same time, Michel will move into the role of President of Tezos core development group Nomadic Labs. Their departure follows February\\u2019s announcement that Tezos Foundation President, Ryan Jesperson, would neither seek re-election nor retain his position within the foundation\\u2019s Executive Committee.\\n\\nIn their place, the foundation appointed two new Council members (Alice Lloyd George and Olivier Jaillon), who will join the four remaining representatives, and veteran member Hubertus Thonhauser will assume the now vacant role of Council Chairman. The Tezos Foundation is also looking to add a seventh Council member and expand its Executive Committee, which will eventually take over the day-to-day managerial duties from the Council.\\n\\nWhy it matters:\\nToday\\u2019s restructuring announcement was not a surprise. The Tezos Foundation alluded to these changes in early March. It believes separating the roles of the Council and Executive Committee will allow the foundation to \\u201cmore effectively\\u201d govern and support the Tezos ecosystem. Additional changes could be in the works. When Ryan Jesperson announced his departure back in February, he mentioned that Council members should serve no more than two years (his statement came two years after joining the foundation as President). Ryan also petitioned for a more public Council nomination and selection process that is open to the greater Tezos community.\\nHow the Tezos Foundation responds to Jesperson\\u2019s comments will be interesting to watch long term. The foundation has a mountain of funds under its control (<a href=\\\"https://messari.io/article/crypto-treasury-management-a-look-at-the-tezos-foundation-portfolio\\\">$635 million</a> as of Jan. 31, 2020), and it holds more XTZ tokens than any other entity. With this amount of capital, it plays a vital role in the adoption and longevity of Tezos. Therefore, improving transparency and inclusivity would help ensure the Tezos Foundation acts in the best of its community.\",\n",

The contract will pause deposits for 10 days to allow developers time to notify users of what happened and allow them to withdraw funds. A full-post mortem will be provided in the coming days to further explain what happened.\\n\\nWhy it matters\\nEfforts to bring bitcoin to Ethereum have ramped up significantly this year, led by WBTC, an ERC20 backed by bitcoin held by BitGo. Recently the token which now has over $22 million of btc locked, was <a href=\\\"https://messari.io/article/wrapped-bitcoin-added-as-a-collateral-type-to-makerdao\\\">added as a collateral type</a> in Maker allowing loans to be drawn against it. This system is effective in bringing bitcoin into the composable Ethereum ecosystem, however, it compromises on the trust minimized nature of DeFi. This is where tBTC was intended to provide a more decentralized alternative, a feat that is clearly more difficult than it appears.\\nUser funds appear to be safe so long as they are withdrawn in this 10 day period but this serves as yet another wake-up call that DeFi should used with extreme caution as it is still highly experimental.\",\n",

       "   'title': 'Kin proposes to move from its fork of Stellar over to Solana',\n",
       "   'content': 'The Kin engineering team has submitted a proposal to migrate Kin from its current Stellar-based chain over to Solana. Kik Iterative Inc., the creators of the Kin cryptoasset, said that Stellar’s five-second block times and limited metadata space within transactions were unsuitable for Kin’s user experience standards. It, therefore, began looking at alternative protocols in Q2 of last year before recently landing on Solana.\\n\\nAccording to the Kin team, Solana offers a substantial improvement in performance (reported 400 ms block times on a local test node). It also provides enough room within on-chain transactions for Kin to add data related to the Kin Rewards Engine (KRE). Otherwise, the project would have to resort to off-chain storage measures.\\n\\nKin developers would need to approve the proposal before any migration could occur. But CoinDesk reports the Solana staff would facilitate the transition, a process that “should be complete in a matter of months.” The switch also comes with a financial incentive for the Kin Foundation. If approved, the Solana Foundation would grant Kin 1% of the total supply of SOL, with 0.1% unlocking for every new one million “monthly active spenders” of KIN over 24 months (starting Jan. 2021).\\n\\nWhy it matters:\\nWhy make a move? The Kin Foundation says that its on-chain activity is accelerating. It self-reported that users spending KIN jumped from 1.5 million in March to 4.4 million in mid-April, hence the need to move to a more performant network. While it’s easy to inflate activity metrics, an analysis by CoinMetrics last year determined Kin does have a “relatively high number of on-chain transactions.” However, the value transferred across the network is lower than other blockchains, indicating Kin is primarily used for micro-transactions.\\nWhat does this say about Solana? While it is yet another green smart contract platform that offers a scalable alternative to existing platforms, it has a novel consensus mechanism in Proof of History, which aims to eliminate the time-intensive process of transaction ordering. But Solana still new, and its performance could degrade to an extent as more validators join the network. There’s also the argument that blockchains don’t have the user base to require highly scalable platforms. Focusing on maximizing transactions per second (TPS) might be putting the cart before the horse. The news is still a boost to Solana, which has announced several new partnerships as of late including one with <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/solana-prioritizes-stablecoin-support-by-partnering-with-terra\">stablecoin project Terra</a>.',\n",

       "   'content': 'Crypto exchanges Bittrex and Binance have (reluctantly) agreed to support Steem <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/upcoming-steem-network-fork-aims-to-seize-assets-from-over-60-accounts\">hard fork 0.23</a>, which seized the assets from 64 former witnesses (totaling 23.6 million STEEM). These witnesses reportedly led the creation of Steem’s contentious clone, Hive, <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/onchainfx-alert-steem-community-plans-a-hard-fork-to-cut-out-tron-owned-steemit\">back in March</a> and blocked current Steem supporters from receiving newly created HIVE tokens. Some have speculated that hard fork 0.23 is a retaliation against the Hive faction.\\n\\nIn an ironic twist, Steem’s upgrade last week sent the seized funds to a specific account (@community321) whose private keys were unknowingly kept by an anti-0.23 fork community member. This owner shipped almost all of the 23.6 million STEM to Bittrex with the message, “these are stolen funds…please return them to their original owners prior to the fork.” In a blog post, Bittrex founder Richie Lai responded that while he doesn’t agree with the outcome, the exchange must adhere to the consensus rules. The funds remain in Bittrex’s position, but it reportedly plans to return them to the @community321 account.\\n\\nThe exchange could be holding the funds until current Steem witnesses regain control of the @community321 account. On Friday, witnesses launched soft fork 0.23.1 to limit the account’s transfer functions and remove community control over it.\\n\\nWhy it matters:\\nThe whole situation is a mess. It helps put in perspective that delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS) chains are very susceptible to hostile takeovers. Even Binance CEO CZ stated that zeroing accounts on a network means “it is overly centralized” (the irony is Binance Chain operates via a similar consensus mechanism at the moment). Warring sects of validators could be the fate of most dPoS chains down the road.\\nThe intra-network fight seems to be heading off-chain at the moment. Some of the former Steem validators affected by the latest hard fork are tentatively preparing to bring a class action lawsuit against exchanges that support it. Andreas Antonopoulos alluded to this outcome in a recent tweet, saying that the fork could result in a class action lawsuit with participating exchanges named defendants. On the opposing side, Decrypt recently reported that Tron creator Justin Sun is working with law enforcement over the HIVE tokens he claims were “stolen” from him.',\n",

       "   'content': 'High level takeaways from our follow-up report on the 2020 halving produced in collaboration with Bitstamp. Read the full report here: <a href=\"https://messari.io/bitcoin-halving-2020/institutional\">Bitcoin\\'s Third Halving: A Thesis for Institutional Investment</a>\\n\\nWhy Bitcoin?\\nCentral bank driven monetary debasement will boost institutional demand for store of value assets like gold and silver. But why Bitcoin? What makes it different from other politically neutral, scarce monetary stores of value?\\n\\nThe answer lies in Bitcoin’s sovereignty, its secular tailwinds, and its upside.\\n\\nSovereignty\\nKings and Queens used to be sovereign, then nation states became sovereign and now, for the first time, a humble computer platform has the aspiration to be sovereign. That is potentially revolutionary. - Wences Casares\\n\\nBitcoin is the first computing platform with the sovereignty of a nation-state. It’s the only monetary asset in the world with absolute scarcity. This scarcity is assured by a massive, global ecosystem of independent and diverse participants who run the Bitcoin protocol. While there are many clones that promise limited supplies, Bitcoin is the only that does so credibly.\\n\\nNo one can be prevented from using the Bitcoin blockchain to store and transfer value. In times of rising geopolitical tension, this is especially important and can’t be said for national currencies held in banks, which can and have historically been restricted and/or expropriated.\\n\\nUnlike monetary metals, bitcoin can be sent across the world in just hours and securely stored with just a seed phrase. This can be done in amounts large or small, providing a massive upgrade over metals.\\n\\nBitcoin is the first digital, politically neutral store-of-value the world has ever seen and its arrival couldn’t be more perfectly timed.\\n\\nSecular Tailwinds\\n\\nMoney is going fully digital.\\n\\nChina’a Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) began testing this year and despite initial regulatory headwinds, Facebook’s Libra is moving forward with a full head of steam. When these projects launch, they will expose billions of people to cryptocurrency related technologies.\\n\\nThese projects will get people comfortable with using cryptocurrency wallets and create massive on-ramps into more decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Combine this with a younger generation who’s expressed more openness toward cryptocurrencies and you have a recipe for mass adoption.\\n\\nUpside\\n\\nWhile the macroeconomic conditions create a positive outlook for precious metals, investors will be drawn to bitcoin because there is simply more upside.\\nBitcoin is not a company. It is a money. Monies are valued in trillions, not billions.\\n\\nThe total value of above-ground gold, which has limited industrial use, is valued at more than $10 trillion. The total value of all the base fiat money in the world is worth nearly $20 trillion dollars. Add in the total value of the global narrow money supply (demand deposits and checking accounts) and that number is $40 trillion.\\n\\nInvestors will be drawn to Bitcoin because there are few opportunities with as much asymmetric upside. To reach gold’s current market cap alone, Bitcoin would need to rise 63x from its current levels.\\n\\nThe truth remains that no one really knows what lies ahead for Bitcoin. With that said, its strong fundamentals, resilience in the face of economic uncertainty, and growing importance in today’s macroeconomic climate merits a look from all investors. What they do from there is anyone\\'s guess.\\n\\nRead the full report here: <a href=\"https://messari.io/bitcoin-halving-2020/institutional\">Bitcoin\\'s Third Halving: A Thesis for Institutional Investment</a>',\n",

       "   'content': 'One of the most maddening things for professional investors regarding the crypto markets is that it’s obvious where liquidity is pooled and price discovery happens, but it’s not well understood or properly calculated anywhere.\\n\\nEfforts like Bitwise’s herculean study into trading volume manipulation helped pierce the veil on legitimate vs. spoofed order books and led to the creation of metrics like Messari’s <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/introducing-real-10-volume-and-liquid-market-cap-on-onchainfx\">“Real 10” Volumes</a>.\\n\\nBut that new metric omitted some of the largest markets in the world. Particularly, venues with some overstated volume, but enormous legitimate trading volume at the same time. Giants like Bithumb, UpBit, and CoinOne in Korea, Liquid in Japan, and most importantly, Huobi, OKEx/OKCoin, and Gate.io in China.\\n\\nOther data services usually either ignore rampant overinflated volumes, conflate spot and derivatives volumes, or both. We decided to curate the data curators and take a common sense, admittedly imperfect, but directionally accurate approach towards estimating real trading volumes. But we knew we needed to add some missing exchanges to our methodology, so have decided to score exchanges for trading volume legitimacy based on a review of 10 different third party stats: exchange rankings, ratings, and liquidity estimates from CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, CryptoCompare, CryptoWatch (Kraken), Nomics, and FTX’s volume monitor, plus onchain transaction data from Chainalysis and other on-chain data providers, and anecdotal data from top traders.\\n\\nAs a result, we’ve added 10 exchanges to our \"real volume” metric, but applied a 50% haircut to the Korean and Chinese exchanges to better approximate their true volumes. We believe this better reflects the magnitude of adjustment necessary vs. simple web traffic comparisons, which usually discount these volumes by ~90%.\\n\\n(For what it\\'s worth, this methodology also better aligns with scoring from FTX’s volume monitor, and the Alameda guys are pretty fucking good at trading.)\\n\\nThe results of our methodology change propel Huobi, OKEx, Liquid, Bithumb, and UPBit into the top 10 by volume without catapulting them past original “Real 10” constituents inaccurately. (Binance remains #1 by real volumes across most listed assets.)\\n\\nImportantly, we will review our methodology quarterly in order to add or remove constituent exchanges, and tweak volume adjustment parameters.\\n\\nIn a perpetual game of data cat and mouse, we believe the most conservative yet accurate method for updating real exchange volume estimates will be analogous to the “hire slow, and fire fast” mantra in recruiting: slowly add additional exchanges as their volumes become material and multiple independent data services verify their data integrity, while quickly removing exchanges whose volumes spike outside of normal bands or raise red flags under third-party review. (Ours included.)\\n\\nThis is a necessary change, but one that may seem counterintuitive at first glance. I can assure you, though, that it is more accurate, if less precise, than alternatives.\\n\\n-TBI\\n\\nP.S. We welcome your feedback!

       "   'content': 'Coinbase’s custody arm has announced clients can now stake their Cosmos (ATOM) tokens through the custodian. The move allows these investors to lock their tokens on the network and collect inflation rewards on their otherwise idle holdings. Coinbase Custody also noted that its Cosmos staking services support delegations from offline storage systems as opposed to often less-secure hot storage alternatives.\\n\\nIn the announcement, the custodian also quietly revealed it also supports staking for Algorand (ALGO) in addition to Tezos (XTZ). Coinbase currently charges a 25% fee on XTZ received via block rewards, but it has not disclosed if this fee will carry over to AGLO or ATOM stakers at this time. According to Staking Rewards, the annual inflation for Cosmos is ~8.3%, while the same for Algorand stands around 5.4%\\n\\nWhy it matters:\\nEver since Coinbase listed ATOM, support for Cosmos staking was inevitable. The exchange turned Tezos staking into a legitimate revenue generator, and it should be only a matter of time before Coinbase opens staking rewards to all customers.\\n\\nWill this have a material impact on price like it did with Tezos? As <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/when-moon-cosmos\">we’ve covered before</a>, Cosmos’ staking model is fundamentally different from Tezos. It doesn’t have a “staking capacity” metric that would force validators to top off their self-stake despots. Cosmos also penalizes error-prone validators by slashing 5% of their total stake weight, placing both validators and delegator funds at risk. While this risk could be a deterrent to some prospective delegators, exchanges that pledge to cover any customer losses (as Coinbase has) could preemptively purchase ATOMs equal to 5% of its stake weight for this insurance fund. From this perspective, Cosmos’ staking model could bear some similarities to Tezos. (h/t Brian Fabian Crain)\\n\\n',\n",

However based on prior research on Satoshi’s coins, the nonce pattern of the block that contained the transaction spent today, does not match the nonce pattern of the blocks Satoshi is likely to have mined. The blocks Satoshi is likely to have mined have a distinct pattern, which can be seen from the very first block mined on Bitcoin. This entity (Patoshi) which many presume to be Satoshi mined more than 1.1 million bitcoins, equivalent to ~6% of the current 18.4 million coin supply.\\n\\nSource: Satoshiblocks\\n\\nWhy it matters:\\nIt is rare to see coins spent from 2009. Many of the coins mined from this period that have yet to move are presumed to be lost. While the coins likely don’t belong to Satoshi, it is the case that a Bitcoin OG spent those coins.\\nThe event and subsequent selloff suggests that there is some anxiety about the potential for Satoshi’s coins being moved.

The company issued the tokenize shares on Ethereum using the ERC-1404 standard, which allows issuers to restrict certain transfer types to remain compliant with securities laws and any contractual obligations. According to TokenSoft, its investors will soon have access to real-time dividend payments in USD, by way of Signature Bank’s Signet platform, as well as the ability to buy and sell these shares on the secondary market.\\n\\nWhy it matters:\\nDespite receiving a lot of attention, tokenized securities have been slow out of the gate. They weren’t crypto enough for most investors knowledgeable on the matter, and traditional investors failed to see the appeal of tokenization over the norm. However, tokenizing shares has some perceived benefits, including improved access to secondary markets (as highlighted by TokenSoft). But the efforts to built more robust market infrastructure (e.g., Overstock’s <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/tzero/profile\">tZERO</a>) have not yet led to an increase in investor demand.\\nERC-1404 was of the deluge of security tokens standards introduced on Ethereum from 2017 into 2018.

V2 includes a number of technical improvements including ERC20/ERC20 swaps, enhanced price oracles, adjustable protocol fees, and flash swaps. The team has set up a migration portal to move liquidity from v1 to v2 as well as an updated interface to get started with the new version which already has $5 million in liquidity and $1.3 million in trading volume over the last 24 hours.\\n\\nWhy it matters\\nThe protocol fee is the one upgrade that will not have an immediate impact as it is set to zero and won’t change for the foreseeable future. However, it has significant ramifications for the sustainability of the protocol as it provides a means for longer-term funding. It also hints at a decentralized governance process in the future that could include the introduction of a token to facilitate these changes similar to Compound’s <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/compound-takes-steps-to-decentralize-by-introducing-a-new-governance-token\">recently launched</a> governance token.\\nV2 provides a number of upgrades that enhance the user experience and should grow the total liquidity and volume of one of the leading decentralized exchanges. This comes at a time when a number of other DEXs have major protocol upgrades including Kyber\\'s Katalyst and IDEX 2.0 \\n\\n',\n",

       "   'title': 'Upcoming Steem network fork aims to seize assets from over 60 accounts',\n",
       "   'content': 'Steem network witnesses (akin to validators) are planning to execute a controversial hard fork tomorrow (May 20) that will introduce two new changes. The more palatable one will reduce the time it takes to unlock staked STEEM tokens (referred to as powering down) from thirteen weeks to just four. The second change, according to an interview with Steem witness Triple A, will aim to seize the accounts and assets of those that “pose a direct threat” to the Steem blockchain. Decrypt estimates the assets at stake total ~$5 million.\\n\\nAmong the 65 targeted accounts (posted earlier today) are the Steem witnesses accused of opposing Tron’s acquisition of Steemit Inc. and organizing the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/onchainfx-alert-steem-community-plans-a-hard-fork-to-cut-out-tron-owned-steemit\">Hive hard fork on Mar. 20</a>. Triple A claims these accounts continue to harass the Steem ecosystem even after splitting off by spamming the network, damaging chain stability, and publicly attacking users, thus “justifying” tomorrow’s hard fork.\\n\\nWhy it matters:\\nThe claims against the Hive network organizers are dubious at best as there isn’t any evidence to support these accusations. According to Decrypt, the seizures could instead be in retaliation for Hive supports excluding specific Steem witnesses from participating in the HIVE airdrop. Either way, this dilemma is another critical blow to the viability of delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) systems, which have not been able to adequately prevent validators from forming cartels and exploiting the network.\\nWhy would witnesses that left Steem for Hive even continue to hold any asset on Steem? The reason has to do with the aforementioned “power down” period. STEEM stakers must wait thirteen weeks to unlock their holdings fully. The in-fighting on Steem began in mid-to-late Feb., roughly twelve weeks ago, and any witnesses that didn’t immediately start powering down would still have assets locked up on the network. For those accounts with access to their funds, trading STEEM for HIVE recently became more difficult as exchange service BlockTrades shut down support for STEEM deposits due to the secrecy behind tomorrow’s hard fork.',\n",

Something you might end up watching passively on a second screen, if at all. They offered no real reason to tune in, as many of the sessions could just as easily be downloaded as podcasts, or restreamed on YouTube. So we wanted to create a conference we thought we’d actually enjoy attending online: a no bullshit, high-signal program that could entice top investors and builders to stop what they’re doing, tune in, and immerse themselves in networking and spontaneous “unconference” sessions that we all know prove to generate the best and most lively discussions at physical events.\\n\\nWe think we\\'ve solved for many of the challenges presented by virtual events by setting an insane standard for speaker curation, investing in a best-in-class \"virtual venue\", and creating an environment that caters to builders vs. service providers.\\n\\nWe’re excited to share the full agenda (and narrative structure) of the event for the first time today, and look forward to taking you from\\xa0\"Red Pill” to full \"Self-Sovereignty” over three days.\\n\\nTake the red pill here \\n\\nDAY 1\\n\\n“Red Pills” - Jun 1 10:00am-1:30pm ET\\nAlmost everyone starts their trip down the crypto rabbit hole in one of three places: Bitcoin, Ethereum, or more recently, Stablecoins.\\n\\nWe kick things off with a State of Crypto (and Messari), by yours truly.

Then The Block’s Frank Chaparro interviews the CEOs of three of the industry’s most important financial services players, Genesis Capital, BitGo, and FireBlocks. While Bloq’s Matt Roszak drills down on crypto’s new issuance models and whether staking, continuous token offerings, and private secondary auctions are \"moon math\" or \"capitalism 2.0”. M&A leads for Kraken, Coinbase, and Binance discuss consolidation trends, while CZ (Binance) and Sam Bankman-Fried (FTX) close things out with a discussion on how their organizations are blitzscaling.\\n\\nPlus some late night derivatives chatter, speed networking, and unlimited after hours\\xa0white boarding.\\n\\nDAY 2\\n \\n“Web 3’s Moment”\\xa0- Jun 2 10:00am-1:30pm ET\\nIs crypto about more than money?

This time, there’s a recap of some of the most popular\\xa0sessions from May’s popular Ready Layer One event, an update on the enterprise ethereum alliance and corporate applications for crypto, and workshops on smart contract security, and rapid prototyping with money legos. Plus more excellent presentations and investor Q&A from projects like Waves, Cardano, ETC, Celo, Sythentix, Cosmos, and Solana.\\xa0\\n\\nDon’t like the group sessions? Start your own 1:1 meetings or\\xa0private group sessions.\\n\\n“DeFi’s Growing Pains” - Jun 2\\xa08:00pm-11:30pm ET\\nMoney Legos is a powerful meme, but so far in 2020, decentralized\\xa0finance has proven just about as fragile. Can DeFi scale securely?\\xa0\\n\\nMessari DeFi analyst, Jack Purdy provides an update on the exploding DeFi market (and its recent vulnerabilities). Then DeFi analysts and security hawks\\xa0Demi Brener, Taylor Monahan, and Yainv\\xa0Tal break down the path forward before in-depth discussions with the top DeFi application creators (Compound, Maker,\\xa0Synthetic), and DEX protocol maintainers (0x, Kyber, Uniswap).

Plus a special keynote from Meltem Demirors, and a closing fireside chat between TBI and USV’s Albert Wenger on the “World After Capital.” \\xa0\\n\\nWith nearly 200 speakers over 100+ discrete sessions, you’d find it impossible to NOT learn from some of the top players in crypto at Mainnet. More importantly, you’d be hard pressed to not have fun, or meet some of your favorite amazing colleagues for updates on the tireless work they are doing to build out the decentralized future.

       "   'content': 'The Tezos Foundation recently concluded its quarterly Council meeting with the announcement that current Council members Ryan Lackey and Michel Mauny will step down. Both will remain directly involved with the project, as Ryan will stay on as an advisor. At the same time, Michel will move into the role of President of Tezos core development group Nomadic Labs. Their departure follows February’s announcement that Tezos Foundation President, Ryan Jesperson, would neither seek re-election nor retain his position within the foundation’s Executive Committee.\\n\\nIn their place, the foundation appointed two new Council members (Alice Lloyd George and Olivier Jaillon), who will join the four remaining representatives, and veteran member Hubertus Thonhauser will assume the now vacant role of Council Chairman. The Tezos Foundation is also looking to add a seventh Council member and expand its Executive Committee, which will eventually take over the day-to-day managerial duties from the Council.\\n\\nWhy it matters:\\nToday’s restructuring announcement was not a surprise. The Tezos Foundation alluded to these changes in early March. It believes separating the roles of the Council and Executive Committee will allow the foundation to “more effectively” govern and support the Tezos ecosystem. Additional changes could be in the works. When Ryan Jesperson announced his departure back in February, he mentioned that Council members should serve no more than two years (his statement came two years after joining the foundation as President). Ryan also petitioned for a more public Council nomination and selection process that is open to the greater Tezos community.\\nHow the Tezos Foundation responds to Jesperson’s comments will be interesting to watch long term. The foundation has a mountain of funds under its control (<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/crypto-treasury-management-a-look-at-the-tezos-foundation-portfolio\">$635 million</a> as of Jan. 31, 2020), and it holds more XTZ tokens than any other entity. With this amount of capital, it plays a vital role in the adoption and longevity of Tezos. Therefore, improving transparency and inclusivity would help ensure the Tezos Foundation acts in the best of its community.',\n",

The contract will pause deposits for 10 days to allow developers time to notify users of what happened and allow them to withdraw funds. A full-post mortem will be provided in the coming days to further explain what happened.\\n\\nWhy it matters\\nEfforts to bring bitcoin to Ethereum have ramped up significantly this year, led by WBTC, an ERC20 backed by bitcoin held by BitGo. Recently the token which now has over $22 million of btc locked, was <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/wrapped-bitcoin-added-as-a-collateral-type-to-makerdao\">added as a collateral type</a> in Maker allowing loans to be drawn against it.

This is where tBTC was intended to provide a more decentralized alternative, a feat that is clearly more difficult than it appears.\\nUser funds appear to be safe so long as they are withdrawn in this 10 day period but this serves as yet another wake-up call that DeFi should used with extreme caution as it is still highly experimental.',\n",
