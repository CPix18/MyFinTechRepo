#Payments and Billing

##The world of banking has evolved by several orders of magnitude over the past 20 years but to really get a sense of where we are today, we need to look at the early history of money and trade. For centuries humans have used "money/value" to exchange goods/services, pay workers to produce goods/services, invest in business capital expenditures, and as a display of wealth in some cases. Before humans had a money like paper dollars, a system of trade and barter was used where if someone needed something in particular, they would trade a physical good they already had for an item they needed. The problem with that was the inefficiencies when exchanging a cow for 3 pigs. How can one determine if that is a good trade or the optimal exchange rate for either animal? Welcome money, either in the form of gold, coin, stone, paper, and numerous other physical objects. These were used as mediums of exchange which made transacting easier. It wasn't until recently where we created "fiat" currencies controlled by government monetary policy. For the most part, these currencies have led to massive inflation and the need to print more money as we see today in countries like Turkey and Venezuela. Then about 11 years ago a huge innovation was created when Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin White Paper. This currency has a rigid supply schedule with a fixed hard cap of coins ever to be produced. The underlying technology is a blockchain supported by a global crypto-economic incentive to "mine" the next block to release Bitcoin into circulation. A lot of people new to Bitcoin get caught up in the volatility of price per Bitcoin to the US dollar but what they often overlook is what Bitcoin brought to the Internet, solutions to the double spend problem and the Byzantine General's Problem. These two attributes along with its fixed monetary policy and proof of work consensus has turned Bitcoin into what it is today.

*Mass adoption of cryptocurrencies and a solution easy enough to onboard general population.

*Private Investment and ICO in 2017, Raised $1M in private equity and $2M through Tokens


##Business Activities

*Metallicius is tackling several fronts of payment technology. First and foremost a payment app like Venmo except it also includes crypto wallets, crypto marketplace, cash wallets, and ability to send both cash and crypto within app for free (they use a consensus mechanism called PoPP- Proof of Processed Payments to reward users in their native currency MTL for sending cash). They also enabled deposits and withdrawals from main net chains. To go along with Metal Pay, they have a non-custodial wallet application called Metal Vault. Marshall Hayner has also teamed up with Erik Finman to create Metal VC a venture capital arm to grow the ecosystem. Metal Pay is also involved in pushing the regulatory space forward for crypto. This past Monday Marshall announced the Crypto-Currency Act of 2020 alongside an Arizona Congressman.  In the near future they are releasing their very own blockchain, Proton, which will leverage EOSIO technology and connect the traditional banking world with Blockchains. Metal Pay aims to solve making the crypto experience easier and more rewarding to use than traditional systems.

*Everyone and anyone with money is the potential market. Right now it is only available for iOS and Android users in 40 or so states but they plan to operate globally in the near future. The size of the market is anyone who transacts in crypto or fiat and has a mobile device with internet connection. Metal's biggest competitive advantage is their underlying blockchain technology. Instead of charging fees to send money they can actually reward their users in a native currency. 

*They are using traditional banking technologies like account and routing numbers, Plaid to connect bank accounts, visa debit to instantly withdraw and deposit cash, blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and EOSIO to facilitate on-chain activities, KYC and AML to deter fraud.

##Landscape

*Payments and Billing, RegTech (PII), Open Banking, Blockchain and Crypto

*Companies use measurements like Monthly Active Users (MAU), Daily Active Users (DAU), transaction volume per day/month, customer retention measurements, new user stats, ROI on marketing and customer acquisition costs, fees associated with on-chain payments.

*Metal Pay has over 150,000 users with millions of dollars transacted over the past year alone. Metal Pay went live in late 2018 so it is still in it's first 2 years of operation.

##Recommendations

*I would advise the company to add a savings account option leveraging MakerDAO's Dai Savings Rate which offers a high yield interest return (currently 8%). I would also advise them to really push global reach as well as getting licenses to operate in states like New York. I'd also like to see them add more utility to their native MTL currency like staking, voting, and rewards based on percentage held. Right now the biggest reason to hold MTL is 10,000 MTL gets a user free trading in the marketplace. 

*I think the world of FinTech moves really fast and there are already big players like CashApp and Robinhood experimenting with Bitcoin so if Metal Pay doesn't move super fast they may get left behind simply because of network effects and loyal customers to other networks.

*More focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Right now the native blockchain Proton will operate on EOSIO because of speed and cheap transaction costs which is fine but there are so many great applications already built on the major blockchains which can be combined to make a one stop solution. 

*After all this is an app with the goal to assist in mass adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. It only makes sense for them to use OG blockchains which have massive developer numbers and DAU to do this.
