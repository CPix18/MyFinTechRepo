Monte Carlo Simulation: 10, 20, 30 Year Outlook of 40% AGG and 60% SPY

After running 500 simulations I was able to get a projection for potential cumulative returns on a 20,000 dollar initial investment

 AGG Average Daily Return: 0.00039952550793326437
 SPY Average Daily Return: -0.0008053578222638612
 
 AGG Standard Deviation: 0.008486930467479845
 SPY Standard Deviation: 0.029950975941050197
 
 There is a 90 percent chance that an initial investment of 20,000 dollars in the portfolio over the next 30 years will end within in the range of 20072.13 dollars and 24338.42 dollars
