# MyFinTechRepo

#  My name is Collin. I'm an avid cryptocurrency enthusiast who is on a mission to make a difference. I recently began a FinTech accelerator through Vanderbilt University to develop an understanding of the technical aspects behind blockchain and smart contracts. I plan to accomplish an understanding of python, pandas, API, machine learning, big data, blockchain development, and solidity. Since graduating college I have learned to brew beer, been an ambassador for a couple crypto start-ups, and dug into the advantages of DeFi on Ethereum as an alternative financial system.

#  There is so much going on in blockchain development and quite a few macro financial-related events happening right now that all I want is to do is be a part of it. Here's to the next 5 years. :)
