# MyFinTechRepo

#  My name is Collin. I'm an avid cryptocurrency enthusiast on a mission to speed up the mass adoption of public blockchains. I recently began a FinTech Bootcamp through Vanderbilt University to develop a deeper understanding of the technical aspects of Python and Blockchain. Throughout this course I will cover topics including python basics, pandas, API, PyViz, Machine Learning, Blockchain Development, and Solidity. Since graduating college I helped brew a Gold Medal Russian Imperial Stout at Great American Beer Fest, promote my favorite crypto/payment app (Metal Pay) every chance I get, and consult Advantage Blockchain on DeFi opportunities.

#  Here's to the next 50 years. :)
