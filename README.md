# MyFinTechRepo

#  My name is Collin. I'm an avid cryptocurrency enthusiast who is on a mission to make a difference for mass adoption of public blockchains. I recently began a FinTech accelerator through Vanderbilt University to develop a deeper understanding of the technical aspects behind blockchain and smart contracts. Throughout this course I will cover topics including python, pandas, API, PyViz, Machine Learning, Blockchain Development, and Solidity. Since graduating college I have learned the art to brewing award winning beer, worked as a brand ambassador for a couple crypto start-ups, and dug into the advantages of DeFi on Ethereum as an alternative financial system.

#  Here's to the next 5 years. :)
