# MyFinTechRepo

#  My name is Collin. I'm an avid cryptocurrency enthusiast who is on a mission to make a difference. I recently began a FinTech accelerator to develop an understanding of the technical advantages of blockchain and smart contracts. I will accomplish an understanding of python, pandas, API, machine learning, big data, blockchain development, and solidity. Since graduating college I have learned to brew beer, been an ambassador for a couple different crypto start-ups, and dug into DeFi on top of Ethereum. 

#  There is so much going on with blockchain development and so many macro financial-related events happening right now and I want to be a part of it. Here's to the next 5 years. :)
