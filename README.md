# MyFinTechRepo

#  My name is Collin. I'm a blockchain and cryptocurrency enthusiast on a mission to share what I have learned over the past few years about crypto and Fintech. I recently began a FinTech Bootcamp through Vanderbilt University to develop a deeper understanding of Python and Blockchain Development. Throughout this course I will accomplish an understanding of Python, Pandas, API, PyViz, Machine Learning, Blockchain Development, and Solidity. In my spare time I love to promote my favorite crypto/payment app (Metal Pay) every chance I get. I also advise Advantage Blockchain, a Philly based blockchain consulting firm, on current trends and opportunities within DeFi.

#  Here's to the next 50 years. :)
